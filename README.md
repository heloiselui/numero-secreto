# Alura: Voice Recognition Game 📢

## Hello there! 👋

In this course, I had the opportunity to dive into the world of voice recognition, where I implemented a game to guess a secret number. I delved into JavaScript, building an entire application from scratch, starting with the HTML structure, adding styles with CSS, and crafting the functionalities with JavaScript.

During this journey, organized this code into separate JavaScript files – one for generating the secret number, another for handling validations, and one more for implementing voice recognition using the Web Speech API.
